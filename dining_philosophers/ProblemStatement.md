# Dining Philosophers

This is a classical synchronization problem proposed by Dijkstra.

Imagine you have five philosophers sitting on a roundtable. The philosophers do only two kinds of activities: i) they contemplate, and ii) they eat. However, they have only five forks between themselves to eat their food with. Each philosopher requires both the fork to his left and the fork to his right to eat his food. Design a solution where each philosopher gets a chance to eat his food without causing a deadlock.
